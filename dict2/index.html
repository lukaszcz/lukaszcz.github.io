<h4>Search types</h4>
<p>
  There are three search types.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Find</b> This is a keyword search. Any definitions
    containig the word searched as a single word will be
    displayed. Inflections and words with a common stem may be listed
    as well by using the 'stem', 'inflect' and 'forms' options. This
    search type is the default - it is invoked when you press
    ENTER.</li>
    <li><b>Find (regex)</b> This is a regular expression search. All
    definitions matching a given POSIX extended regular expression
    will be displayed. For more information on regular expression see
    e.g. man grep.</li>
    <li><b>Find (exact)</b> This is an exact match search. The 'stem',
    'inflect' and 'forms' options are not taken into account, and only
    definitions matching exactly the phrase typed are displayed.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>The stem, inflect and forms options</h4>
<p>
  You may search words with a stem common with the word typed by
  checking the 'stem' checkbutton. For instance, searching 'ausmachen'
  gives 'machen' as one of the translations. This option may be
  combined with the inflection search - searching inflections of a
  word. If these two buttons are checked then looking for e.g.
  'gemacht' gives 'machen' and 'ausmachen' among other results. If
  only the 'inflect' option is chosen, 'ausmachen' is not displayed.
</p>
<p>
  Another option similar to the two described is the 'forms' option -
  checking it enables searching words which are derived from the word
  typed, but have a different grammatical form (e.g. you type a verb
  and get a noun). For instance, if you search 'Ruhe' with this option
  enabled, you get 'ruhig' among other results.
</p>
<p>
  The more of these three options you use, the slower your searches
  become. If you have a slow computer you might consider unchecking
  all of them. On modern machines, however, the difference in speed is
  usually imperceptible.

<h4>Viewing a definition</h4>
<p>
  If you want to copy text from one of the results, just select the
  desired line in the results view and click the 'View definition'
  button or double-click the line. This shows the definition is a
  separate window. This feature is also useful if the text is too long
  and you can't see the whole of it.
