Below is an incomplete list of open source software I've written over
the years. The projects range from small programs with several hundred
lines to medium-sized projects of 10k-30k lines. Some are in a
prototype stage, but all have been tested, debugged and completed
enough for at least basic usability.

* [CoqHammer](https://coqhammer.github.io): An automated reasoning
  system for Coq.
* [Coinduction](https://github.com/lukaszcz/coinduction#readme): A Coq
  plugin which helps with proofs by coinduction.
* [HCPL](https://github.com/lukaszcz/hcpl#readme): A prototypical
  proof checker and programming language based on illative combinatory
  logic.
* [PascalAdt](https://pascaladt.github.io): A library of data
  structures and algorithms for the Free Pascal compiler.
* [Javalette](https://github.com/lukaszcz/javalette#readme): An
  educational compiler for Javalette - a subset of C without pointers
  and dynamic memory allocation.
* [Asm32](https://github.com/lukaszcz/asm32#readme): An educational
  assembler for a subset of 32bit x86 instructions. Produces Linux ELF
  executables.
* [MCP](https://github.com/lukaszcz/mcp#readme): A macro processor.
* [Dict2](https://github.com/lukaszcz/dict2#readme): A dictionary
  viewing application for Linux.
* [SrcDoc](https://github.com/lukaszcz/srcdoc#readme): A documentation
  generator a la doxygen for Free Pascal and Delphi.
* [HexCalc](https://github.com/lukaszcz/hexcalc#readme): A calculator
  which lets you see the results of various x86 instructions. Written
  in x86 assembly.
* [Snake](https://github.com/lukaszcz/snake#readme): A snake game for
  Linux written in x86 assembly.
