Below is an incomplete list of Coq formalisations I've written over
the years. These range from small formalisations with several hundred
lines to bigger projects with thousands of lines formalising entire
papers.

* [A coinductive confluence proof for the infinitary lambda calculus](https://github.com/lukaszcz/infinitary-confluence): A formalisation of my [paper](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6194)
  about the infinitary lambda calculus.
* [Confluence of
  an extension of Combinatory Logic by boolean constants](https://github.com/lukaszcz/clc):
  A formalisation of my [paper](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7736/)
  which solves open problem 15 from the RTA list of open problems.
* [Concrete semantics with Coq and CoqHammer](https://github.com/lukaszcz/COQ-IMP):
  A re-formalisation in Coq of several chapters from the book
  "Concrete Semantics with Isabelle/HOL". The formalisation concerns
  operational semantics and compilation correctness for a simple
  imperative language. In cooperation with Burak Ekici and Cezary
  Kaliszyk.
* [Sorting algorithms](https://github.com/lukaszcz/sortalgs): quick
  sort, merge sort, insertion sort, selection sort.
* [Binary search trees](https://github.com/lukaszcz/bst).
* [Diaconescu's theorem](https://github.com/lukaszcz/diaconescu).
* [Finite Ramsey's theorem](https://github.com/lukaszcz/ramsey)
