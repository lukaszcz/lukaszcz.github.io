Hello! My name is Łukasz Czajka. I'm a researcher in broadly
understood
[computational logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science).

### Interests

Most of my theoretical [publications](/papers/) fall at the border of
[type theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/) and
[term rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting). I've also
worked on the
[infinitary lambda calculus](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6194) and
[combinatory logic](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7736/).

I'm interested in automation for proof assitants and proof search in
non-classical logics. I'm the main developer and maintainer of the
[CoqHammer](https://coqhammer.github.io) automated reasoning system
for [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr). I wrote a
[Coq plugin](https://github.com/lukaszcz/coinduction) to help with
proofs by coinduction.

Recently, I've been working on
[proof search in dependent type theory](/papers/sauto.pdf) and
intuitionistic logic, and on improving automation for disjunctive
formulas in [IRIS](https://iris-project.org).

Outside of my research, I maintain a general interest in functional
programming, theory and implementation of programming languages, and
deductive program verification. I've done some [teaching](/teaching/)
related to
[these](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/cms/de/Lehre/Lehrveranstaltungen/2019WS/POPL/index.html)
[topics](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/cms/de/Lehre/Lehrveranstaltungen/2020SS/ATLSE/index.html).

In the past, during my student years and earlier, aside of my ongoing
interest in logic and theoretical computer science, I engaged in
[compiler construction](https://github.com/lukaszcz/javalette#readme),
design and implementation of
[programming](https://github.com/lukaszcz/mcp#readme)
[languages](https://github.com/lukaszcz/hcpl#readme), low-level
[programming](https://github.com/lukaszcz/asm32#readme), and
implementation of efficient
[algorithms and data structures](https://pascaladt.github.io). I still
remember much from that. See also my
[old software projects](/software/).

### Bio

I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Warsaw](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl) under
supervision of [Paweł Urzyczyn](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~urzy/). Then I was a postdoc in [Innsbruck](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/) where I
developed [CoqHammer](https://coqhammer.github.io) with
[Cezary Kaliszuk](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/cek/).
After that I received a [Marie Curie Individual Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) to move to
[Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/) and work on an [infinitary rewriting
interpretation of coinductive types](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6097). Now
I am at the [Technical University of
Dortmund](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de).
