Hello! My name is Łukasz Czajka. I'm a compiler engineer and a
programming language designer. I used to work full-time in academia
doing research in broadly understood [computational
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_in_computer_science), which
I still pursue as a hobby.

### Interests

Currently, I work on the design and implementation of the
functional programming language [Juvix](https://juvix.org).

I'm interested in type theory, functional programming, theory and
implementation of programming languages, and deductive program
verification. I've done some [teaching](/teaching/) related to
[these](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/cms/de/Lehre/Lehrveranstaltungen/2019WS/POPL/index.html)
[topics](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/cms/de/Lehre/Lehrveranstaltungen/2020SS/ATLSE/index.html).

My principal research interests include automation for proof
assistants and proof search in non-classical logics. I'm the main
developer and maintainer of the
[CoqHammer](https://coqhammer.github.io) automated reasoning system
for [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr). I wrote a [Coq
plugin](https://github.com/lukaszcz/coinduction) to help with proofs
by coinduction. I've been working on [proof search in dependent type
theory](/papers/sauto.pdf) and intuitionistic logic, and on improving
automation for disjunctive formulas in
[IRIS](https://iris-project.org).

During my past academic career, I published some theoretical
[papers](/papers/) at the border of [type
theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/) and [term
rewriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting). I've also worked
on the [infinitary lambda calculus](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6194)
and [combinatory](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7736/)
[logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3672).

I have a solid background in [proof assistants](/formalizations/),
[compiler construction](https://github.com/lukaszcz/javalette#readme),
design and implementation of [programming
languages](https://github.com/lukaszcz/hcpl#readme), low-level systems
[programming](https://github.com/lukaszcz/asm32#readme), and
implementation of efficient [algorithms and data
structures](https://pascaladt.github.io). See also my [software
projects](/software/).

### Bio

I received my Ph.D. from the [University of
Warsaw](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl) under supervision of [Paweł
Urzyczyn](http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~urzy/). Then I was a postdoc in
[Innsbruck](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/) where I developed
[CoqHammer](https://coqhammer.github.io) with [Cezary
Kaliszyk](http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/cek/).  After that I
received a [Marie Curie Individual
Fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)
to move to [Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/) and work on an [infinitary
rewriting interpretation of coinductive
types](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6097). Then I spent several years
as a researcher at the [Technical University of
Dortmund](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de). Now I work in the
industry.
